******************************************************************************
Format of the text file for py-MVO's input parameters:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<Image Sequence's Directory>
<Images' File Format (e.g. PNG, JPG)>
<Boolean: Type True if Projection Matrix is used else type None>
<Projection Matrix: is a 3x4 matrix; input as 1-D array, if CameraIntrinsicMat is used: type None>
<CameraIntrinsicMatrix: is a 3x3 matrix; input as 1-D array, if ProjectionMat true: type None>
<Feature Detector: SIFT, FAST, SURF, SHI-TOMASI>
<GPS Flag: List of flags available are below, if no GPS: type None>
<Ground Truth Poses: a text file with the transformation matrices as 1-D arrays(KITTI dataset format>
<Window Display Flag: List of flags available are below>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GPS Flags:

If the images have GPS data in the EXIF file, then some flags can be input
in order to produce specific trajectories for comparison or merging. The trajectories
are plotted in the same graph as the Visual Odometry(VO) trajectory.

- GPS_NO: No GPS is provided.

- GPS_T: Plots the trajectory of the GPS coordinates.

- GPS_T_M: Plots the trajectory of the GPS coordinates and formulates a trajectory which merges
           the GPS and VO.

Ground Truth Text File:

- Is a text file which contains the transformation matrices of the image sequence. The matrices
  are written as 1-D array and take one line. Use the format given by the KITTI dataset in their
  odometry ground truth poses folder.
  *You may download such folder at http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php
- Type: None, if no ground truth is going to be provided.
- If indeed ground truth is provided it will be used for scaling, instead of the relative scale.

Windowed Displays Flags:

Flags which determine if the windowed displays are going to be displayed.

- WINDOW_NO: Does not display any window.

- WINDOW_T: Displays only the trajectories.

- WINDOW_YES: Displays all windows.

SUBSTITUTE THE LINES BELOW, WITH THE ACTUAL INFORMATION YOU ARE GOING TO USE
FOR THE VISUAL ODOMETRY RUN.

*Erase the included angle brackets.
**Don't erase any of the information between the asterisks neither eliminate
whitespace due to the fact that the program is line-based when reading the file
